- Incident Date: ${req.incidentDate}
- Location: ${req.location}
- Type of Concern: ${concernTypesText}
- Severity Level: ${req.severityLevel}
- Actions Already Taken: ${actionsTakenText}
- Detailed Description: ${req.concernDescription}

Based on the concern type(s) identified (${concernTypesText}) and severity level (${req.severityLevel}), please provide specific, actionable Tier 2 intervention recommendations that a teacher could implement in the classroom. Focus on evidence-based strategies that address the described concerns.

Format your response as follows:
1. **Assessment Summary** - Brief analysis of the student's needs based on the concern type and severity
2. **Immediate Interventions** (1-2 weeks) - Quick strategies to implement right away
3. **Short-term Strategies** (2-6 weeks) - More comprehensive interventions
4. **Long-term Support** (6+ weeks) - Sustained support strategies
5. **Progress Monitoring** - How to track effectiveness
6. **When to Escalate** - Clear indicators for referring to student support team

For each strategy, include:
- Strategy name/title
- Clear implementation steps
- Expected outcomes
- Timeline for implementation
- Materials/resources needed

Use professional educational terminology and ensure recommendations are practical and classroom-friendly. Structure your response with clear headings and bullet points for easy reading.`;

Based on the ${req.severityLevel} level concerns related to ${concernTypes} for ${req.studentFirstName} ${req.studentLastInitial}. (Grade ${req.grade}), the following Tier 2 interventions are recommended to address the observed challenges in ${req.location}.

## Immediate Interventions (1-2 weeks)

**1. Structured Check-In System**
- Implementation: Daily 2-minute check-ins at the beginning of class
- Expected outcomes: Improved communication and early identification of issues
- Timeline: Start immediately, continue for 2 weeks minimum
- Materials needed: Simple check-in form or digital tool

**2. Clear Expectations and Visual Supports**
- Implementation: Create visual schedule and behavior expectations chart
- Expected outcomes: Increased understanding of classroom routines
- Timeline: Implement within 3 days
- Materials needed: Poster board, markers, laminator

## Short-term Strategies (2-6 weeks)

**3. Targeted Skill Building**
- Implementation: 15-minute focused sessions 3x per week
- Expected outcomes: Improvement in specific skill areas
- Timeline: 4-6 week intervention cycle
- Materials needed: Skill-specific worksheets and manipulatives

**4. Peer Support System**
- Implementation: Pair student with trained peer mentor
- Expected outcomes: Improved social skills and academic support
- Timeline: 4 weeks with weekly check-ins
- Materials needed: Peer mentor training materials

## Long-term Support (6+ weeks)

**5. Comprehensive Behavior Plan**
- Implementation: Develop individualized behavior intervention plan
- Expected outcomes: Sustained positive behavior changes
- Timeline: Ongoing with monthly reviews
- Materials needed: Data collection sheets, reward system

**6. Family Collaboration**
- Implementation: Regular communication with family about strategies
- Expected outcomes: Consistent support across environments
- Timeline: Ongoing partnership
- Materials needed: Communication log, home-school collaboration forms

## Progress Monitoring

- Weekly data collection on target behaviors/skills
- Bi-weekly review of intervention effectiveness
- Monthly team meetings to assess progress
- Use of standardized assessment tools as appropriate

## When to Escalate

Consider referring to the student support team if:
- No improvement after 4-6 weeks of consistent intervention
- Behaviors escalate in frequency or intensity
- Student expresses safety concerns
- Additional assessment needs are identified
- Family requests formal evaluation

**Note:** This is a demonstration of AI-generated recommendations. In a real implementation, these would be more detailed and specifically tailored to the exact concerns described.`;
